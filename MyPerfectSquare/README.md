MyPerfectSquare  
===============  
  
TI .8x program for customized perfect square calculation. (Compatible with TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus)  
- Works only for polynomials of the form 9x² + 8y² + 3z² + –126x + 160y + –66z + 1600= 0.  
- It will group like variables together to perform 3 separate perfect square calculations. 
- MYPERFSQ is the main program
- NUMSTR is a sub program that when run in conjunction within another program, converts a number to a string for better readability.
  
How to use the program (MYPERFSQ):  
0) Load both programs (MYPERFSQ and NUMSTR) into calculator and run MYPERFSQ.  
1) Input the coeffecients of the polynomial in sequential order:  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - for example if the polynomial is "9x² + 8y² + 3z² + –126x + 160y + –66z + 1600= 0 ",  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;press "9", "Enter", "8", "Enter", "3", "Enter", "-126", "Enter", "160", "Enter", "-66", "Enter", "1600".  
2) The program will output the first term.  
3) Press "Enter" to display the second term.  
4) Press "Enter" again to display the third term.  
5) Press "Enter" again to display the last term.

\>\> \<Enter\>  
\>\> 8  
\>\> \<Enter\>  
\>\> 3  
\>\> \<Enter\>
